"""send ui.log() data to a subprocess (EXPERIMENTAL)

This extension lets you specify a shell command per ui.log() event,
sending all remaining arguments to as environment variables to that command.

Each positional argument to the method results in a `MSG[N]` key in the
environment, starting at 1 (so `MSG1`, `MSG2`, etc.). Each keyword argument
is set as a `OPT_UPPERCASE_KEY` variable (so the key is uppercased, and
prefixed with `OPT_`). The original event name is passed in the `EVENT`
environment variable, and the process ID of mercurial is given in `HGPID`.

So given a call `ui.log('foo', 'bar', 'baz', spam='eggs'), a script configured
for the `foo` event can expect an environment with `MSG1=bar`, `MSG2=baz`, and
`OPT_SPAM=eggs`.

Scripts are configured in the `[logtoprocess]` section, each key an event name.
For example::

  [logtoprocess]
  commandexception = echo "$MSG2$MSG3" > /var/log/mercurial_exceptions.log

would log the warning message and traceback of any failed command dispatch.

Scripts are run asynchronously as detached daemon processes; mercurial will
not ensure that they exit cleanly.
