"""check for unrecorded moves at commit time (EXPERIMENTAL)

This extension checks at commit/amend time if any of the committed files
comes from an unrecorded mv.

The threshold at which a file is considered a move can be set with the
``automv.similarity`` config option. This option takes a percentage between 0
(disabled) and 100 (files must be identical), the default is 95.

"""

# Using 95 as a default similarity is based on an analysis of the mercurial
# repositories of the cpython, mozilla-central & mercurial repositories, as
# well as 2 very large facebook repositories. At 95 50% of all potential
# missed moves would be caught, as well as correspond with 87% of all
# explicitly marked moves.  Together, 80% of moved files are 95% similar or
# more.
#
# See http://markmail.org/thread/5pxnljesvufvom57 for context.
