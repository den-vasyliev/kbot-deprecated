"""Lazy loading for Python 3.6 and above.

This uses the new importlib finder/loader functionality available in Python 3.5
and up. The code reuses most of the mechanics implemented inside importlib.util,
but with a few additions:

* Allow excluding certain modules from lazy imports.
* Expose an interface that's substantially the same as demandimport for
  Python 2.

This also has some limitations compared to the Python 2 implementation:

* Much of the logic is per-package, not per-module, so any packages loaded
  before demandimport is enabled will not be lazily imported in the future. In
  practice, we only expect builtins to be loaded before demandimport is
  enabled.
