    '''track 3-way merge state of individual files

    The merge state is stored on disk when needed. Two files are used: one with
    an old format (version 1), and one with a new format (version 2). Version 2
    stores a superset of the data in version 1, including new kinds of records
    in the future. For more about the new format, see the documentation for
    `_readrecordsv2`.

    Each record can contain arbitrary content, and has an associated type. This
    `type` should be a letter. If `type` is uppercase, the record is mandatory:
    versions of Mercurial that don't support it should abort. If `type` is
    lowercase, the record can be safely ignored.

    Currently known records:

    L: the node of the "local" part of the merge (hexified version)
    O: the node of the "other" part of the merge (hexified version)
    F: a file to be merged entry
    C: a change/delete or delete/change conflict
    D: a file that the external merge driver will merge internally
       (experimental)
    P: a path conflict (file vs directory)
    m: the external merge driver defined for this merge plus its run state
       (experimental)
    f: a (filename, dictionary) tuple of optional values for a given file
    X: unsupported mandatory record type (used in tests)
    x: unsupported advisory record type (used in tests)
    l: the labels for the parts of the merge.

    Merge driver run states (experimental):
    u: driver-resolved files unmarked -- needs to be run next time we're about
       to resolve or commit
    m: driver-resolved files marked -- only needs to be run before commit
    s: success/skipped -- does not need to be run any more

    Merge record states (stored in self._state, indexed by filename):
    u: unresolved conflict
    r: resolved conflict
    pu: unresolved path conflict (file conflicts with directory)
    pr: resolved path conflict
    d: driver-resolved conflict

    The resolve command transitions between 'u' and 'r' for conflicts and
    'pu' and 'pr' for path conflicts.
