    names for files deleted in c1 that were renamed in c2 or vice-versa.

    Assumes that moves or renames are of following two types:

    1) Inside a directory only (same directory name but different filenames)
    2) Move from one directory to another
                    (same filenames but different directory names)

    Works only when there are no merge commits in the "source branch".
    Source branch is commits from base up to c2 not including base.

    If merge is involved it fallbacks to _fullcopytracing().

    Can be used by setting the following config:

        [experimental]
        copytrace = heuristics

    In some cases the copy/move candidates found by heuristics can be very large
    in number and that will make the algorithm slow. The number of possible
    candidates to check can be limited by using the config
    `experimental.copytrace.movecandidateslimit` which defaults to 100.
