                            KSBA Overview
                            -------------

KSBA (pronounced Kasbah) is a library to make X.509 certificates as
well as the CMS easily accessible by other applications.  Both
specifications are building blocks of S/MIME and TLS.

KSBA is made available as a standard shared library and reserves
identifiers starting with "ksba" and "_ksba" (also uppercase and mixed
case).  It does not rely on another cryptographic library.


                            Documentation
                            -------------

A standard info format reference manual is included.  However the OCSP
feature has not yet been documented.  See the comments in src/ocsp.c
and the example tests/t-ocsp.c.  The GnuPG's dirmngr module makes
extensive use of the OCSP feature and may be used as another example.
