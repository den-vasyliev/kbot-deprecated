PIN entry for Debian
--------------------

This package and its sibling packages are intended to be used as a
pass-phrase entry dialog for the program gpg-agent (Debian package
gnupg-agent).  To configure gpg-agent to use one of the provided
pinentry programs, put something like this into your
~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf:

    pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-FLAVOR

You have the following pinentry variants to choose from:

/usr/bin/pinentry
    Generic name that points, via the Debian alternatives system, to
    the "best" installed PIN entry program.  gpg-agent uses this by
    default.

/usr/bin/pinentry-x11
    Generic name that points, via the Debian alternatives system, to
    the "best" installed PIN entry program with X11 support (that is,
    one of the GTK+ or Qt flavors).

/usr/bin/pinentry-curses
    Text-mode PIN entry program that uses the curses tool kit (package
    pinentry-curses).

/usr/bin/pinentry-gtk-2
    Graphical PIN entry program that uses the GTK+ tool kit version 2
    (package pinentry-gtk2).

/usr/bin/pinentry-qt4
    Graphical PIN entry program that uses the Qt tool kit version 4
    (package pinentry-qt4).

The programs pinentry-gtk-2 and pinentry-qt4 automatically fall back
to the curses interface if no X Window System is available.  So for
example, if you frequently switch between text mode and KDE, and you
want to use both Mutt and KMail with GnuPG pass-phrase agent support,
then configuring /usr/bin/pinentry-qt4 would work.  (In this case,
leaving it at /usr/bin/pinentry would also work, since pinentry-qt4 is
the preferred alternative overall, but if you prefer to use, say,
pinentry-gtk-2, then you need to set it up explicitly (or manually
alter the alternatives system; the possibilities abound).)

Note that while pinentry-curses will work in some cases in a
non-graphical environment, it is likely to fail when used while
sharing a tty with a terminal-intensive program like emacs.  If a
graphical pinentry isn't possible, the recommended workaround is to
have a curses-based pinentry attached to a separate pseudoterminal.
(see https://dev.gnupg.org/T3217 for more details)

Note that for the complete system to work, you also need to configure
GnuPG to use the gpg-agent to get the pass phrases, and you need to
configure your e-mail client to use GnuPG.  These issues are not
covered here.
