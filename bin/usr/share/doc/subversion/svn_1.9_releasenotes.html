<p>Apache Subversion 1.9 is a superset of all previous Subversion
releases, and is as of the time of its release considered the current
"best" release.  Any feature or bugfix in 1.0.x through 1.8.x is also
in 1.9, but 1.9 contains features and bugfixes not present in any
earlier release.  The new features will eventually be documented in a
1.9 version of the free Subversion book
(<a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/" >svnbook.red-bean.com</a>).</p>

<p>This page describes only major changes.  For a complete list of
changes, see the 1.9 section of the <a
href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/CHANGES" >CHANGES</a>
file.</p>

</div>  <!-- news -->

<div class="h2" id="compatibility">
<h2>Compatibility Concerns
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#compatibility"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h2>

<p>Older clients and servers interoperate transparently with 1.9
servers and clients.  However, some of the new 1.9 features may not be
available unless both client and server are the latest version.  There are
also cases where a new feature will work but will run less efficiently if
the client is new and the server old.</p>

<p>There is <strong>no need</strong> to <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.reposadmin.maint.html#svn.reposadmin.maint.migrate.svnadmin"
>dump and reload</a> your repositories. 
Subversion 1.9 servers can read and write to repositories created by
earlier versions.  To upgrade an existing server installation, just install the
newest libraries and binaries on top of the older ones.</p>

<p>Subversion 1.9 maintains API/ABI compatibility with earlier
releases, by only adding new functions, never removing old ones.  A
program written to any previous 1.x API can both compile
and run using 1.9 libraries.  However, a program written for 1.9
cannot necessarily compile or run against older libraries.</p>

<p>There may be limited cases where the behavior of old APIs has been
slightly modified from previous releases.  These are cases where edge cases
of the functionality has been deemed buggy, and therefore improved or removed.
Please consult the
<a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/notes/api-errata/1.9/"
>API errata</a> for more detailed information on what these APIs are
and what impact these changes may have.</p>

<h3>Upgrading the Working Copy
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#wc-upgrade"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h3>

<p>Subversion 1.9 uses the same working copy format as Subversion 1.8.</p>

<p>Before using Subversion 1.9 with an existing Subversion 1.7 or older
working copy, users will be required to run the <tt>svn upgrade</tt> command
to upgrade working copy metadata to the new format. This command may take a
while in some cases, and for some users, it may be more practical to simply
checkout a new working copy.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Subversion 1.9 cannot upgrade working copies that
a 1.6 client would have refused to operate upon before an <tt>svn cleanup</tt>
was run (with a 1.6 client).  In other words, before upgrading to 1.9, a 1.6
or older client must be used to run <tt>svn cleanup</tt> on all 1.6 or older
working copies that require cleanup.  Likewise, Subversion 1.9 cannot upgrade
corrupt working copies. Unfixable problems can arise from missing or corrupt
meta-data inside <tt>.svn</tt> directories.  Such damage to the working copy
is permanent, and cannot be fixed even if <tt>svn cleanup</tt> is run prior
to the upgrade.</p>

<p>If your working copy does not upgrade cleanly, please check out a new one.
</p>

<h4>Python (optional dependency) must be â¥2.7

<p>The <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> programming language is an
optional dependency.  It is required for running the test suite and for
building nightly versions, but not for building from packaged releases.</p>

<p>SubversionÂ 1.8 supported PythonÂ 2.5 and newer.  SubversionÂ 1.9 requires
PythonÂ 2.7.  Older versions of Python are no longer guaranteed to work.</p>

<p>We break compatibility with PythonÂ 2.6 and older since it has been
end-of-life for nearly two years, and in order to introduce compatibility with
PythonÂ 3.x in patch releases of the 1.9.x line.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Compatibility Notes
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#compat-misc"

<p>There are some additional specific areas where changes made in this
release might necessitate further adjustment by administrators or
users.  We'll cover those in this section.</p>

<div class="h4" id="next-release-is-1.10">
<h4>Next release will be numbered 1.10
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#next-release-is-1.10"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h4>

<p>The next minor release after 1.9.0 will be numbered 1.10.0.</p>

<p>Since "1.10.0" is smaller than "1.9.0" when considered as ASCII strings,
scripts that compare Subversion versions as strings may fail to correctly
determine which of "1.10.0" and "1.9.0" is the more recent one.  Such
scripts should be changed to compare Subversion version numbers correctly:
as tuples of integers, with an optional suffix for development or pre-release
versions.  See
<a href="/docs/community-guide/releasing#release-numbering"
>the Subversion release numbering documentation</a>
for details.  (Programs written against the C API or the various bindings
should refer to the 
<!-- TODO: link is broken (doxygen not yet generated) -->
<a href="https://subversion.apache.org/docs/api/1.9/svn__version_8h.html"
><tt>svn_version_*</tt> interfaces</a>.)</p>

<p>The next patch releases on the 1.9.x line will be numbered 1.9.1, 1.9.2,
&hellip;, as usual.</p>

<h4>Format bump
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#fsfs-format7"
     title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h4>

<p>The default filesystem format is now a new format, numbered 7.
(The new command <a href="#svnadmin-info" title="svnadmin info">
<tt>svnadmin info</tt></a> displays the filesystem format number
of a repository.)
In contrast to previous
releases, format 7 is a major overhaul with the general goal of I/O reduction.
Major changes include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Revision content is no longer addressed by physical location (offset)
      within the rev file but by logical item numbers.  Two indexes provide
      the necessary mapping information.  You can no longer manipulate the
      rev / pack file contents manually.</li>
  <li><tt>svnadmin pack</tt> reorders the revision data such that related
      information is put next to each other and can often be read with a
      single I/O.</li>
  <li>Block reads are an option now and will fetch data in larger blocks of
      configurable size (64kB by default) and cache all of their contents.
      This eliminates much of the OS overhead.</li>
  <li>Explicit flags for <tt>svn:mergeinfo</tt> changes speed up
      mergeinfo-related operations like <tt>svn log -g</tt>.</li>
  <li>Full checksum coverage of all revision data, including meta data and
      structural information.</li>
  <li>Allow commits while packing is in progress.</li>
</ul>

<p>As with earlier releases, you may simply run <tt>svnadmin upgrade</tt> on
your repository.  However, the new addressing, checksumming and packing scheme
will not be used in that case but only in repositories that got created as format
7. For best performance and to enable all features, it is recommended to
perform a full
<a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.reposadmin.maint.html#svn.reposadmin.maint.migrate.svnadmin">
dump / load</a> cycle.  You can tell whether all formatÂ 7 features are enabled
by looking for <tt>FSFS Logical Addressing: yes</tt> in the output of
<tt>svnadmin info</tt>: if that line is printed, then the repository has
all formatÂ 7 features enabled.
</p>

<div class="notice">
  <p><span style="color: red"><b>WARNING:</b></span> <b>Server restart
  required!</b>  Replacing an existing repository with one rebuilt from a
  dump or restored from backup requires a server restart.  This is true for
  any repository format.  Alternatively, you may store the new repository in
  a different directory and redirect the Apache configuration to use that
  instead of the old one; <tt>svnserve</tt> does not offer that option.</p>
</div>

<p>The next subsection compares performance characteristics of repositories
created directly as formatÂ 7 with those upgraded to formatÂ 7 from older formats.

<p>The FSFS changes in 1.9 are aimed at better service quality and do not
translate into client-side features being available or not.  Depending on
your setup, some of the improvements may be relevant while others are not.

      <p><sup>4</sup> Not only user file contents, directories and properties
      are protected by checksums but also the meta-data tying them together.

      <p><sup>6</sup> Core feature of format 7.  Revision data is read about
      twice as fast as with older formats.  Assuming reading data from disk
      being 10x slower than from OS caches and a mere 10% OS cache misses,
      this translates into 30% higher overall throughput with format 7 over
      previous formats.</p>

</table>

<p>Most users will want to not only <tt>svnadmin upgrade</tt> to migrate
their repositories but to eventually migrate them to format 7.  For some,
it will be the fast verification feature, others will need the disk I/O
improvements. Note that the key I/O characteristics here is the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth-delay_product">Bandwidth
Delay Product</a> of your storage, which is usually between 100kB and 1MB.
Even with SSDs you will see a speed-up, unless your storage bandwidth is
severely limited.
</p>

<p>There is no appreciable difference in CPU usage between the new format
and the older ones.  Hence, the few setups that work almost entirely from
RAM due to very large caches will see little extra performance with format
7.  These environments will still benefit from the improved checksum coverage
and the support for quick verification.

  <p>Make sure to run <tt>svnadmin pack</tt> on your format 7 repositories

<h4>Zlib compresssion is now optional

<p>FSFS uses a combination of two methods to reduce on-disk data size.  First,
we determine the changes (delta) against some previous version of the same file.
This process can be controlled by <tt>fsfs.conf</tt> settings since 1.8.  The result
would then be compressed using ZIP/deflate.  That relatively costly operation
limits commit speeds of large incompressible files.  You may now specify the
compression level in <tt>fsfs.conf</tt> or disable compression entirely:

repositories in 1.6 format or newer.  Various optimizations were added to the
delta creation code to minimize the read amplification effect and to provide
a net speedup when using deltification vs. not using it.  Keep
<a href="#fsfs-caching">txdelta caches</a> enabled when using directories
deltification. Otherwise, you may suffer a significant performance hit.</p>

<p>To prevent Subversion 1.9 from deltifying properties and directories in
older format repositories, set the following options in the

<h4>Changes to the caching
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#fsfs-caching"
     title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h4>

<p>The caching logic has been enhanced to cope with the extra load caused by
the access indirection introduced in FSFS format 7.  While most of this simply
means more net speed, some changes may affect your configuration settings.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fulltext and txdelta caching are now enabled by default for all servers
      as well as for local repository access.</li>
  <li>Revision property caching is disabled and the respective server option
      will be ignored.</li>
  <li>Directories 3x as large as in 1.8 can now be cached.</li>
  <li>Caching is quasi-perfect on short time scales (requesting data equal or
      less than approx. 10% of the cache size).  This greatly improves
      performance when e.g. many clients check out the same project.</li>
  <li>Long-term caching is now priority-based with text deltas having the lowest
      priority.  This results in slower but more reliable heating up, i.e. it
      takes multiple similar requests until all frequently used data is kept in
      cache, but it will reach this point eventually while older releases might
      not.</li>

<h4>Reading and writing format 7 indexes
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#svnfsfs-index-manipulation"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h4>

<p>During forensics or data recovery, it is necessary for experts to
directly "look into" the raw database files.  While the FSFS on-disk
format is fully documented, the indirect addressing and reordering
added in format 7 makes it hard for humans to trace internal references.
This is where the <tt>svnfsfs dump-index</tt> sub-command is used.
It produces a table describing all items in revision and pack files:
</p>

<pre>
    $ svnfsfs dump-index /path/to/repo -r0
       Start       Length Type   Revision     Item Checksum
           0           11 drep          0        3 60232b75
          11           59 node          0        2 403dbe48
          6a            1 chgs          0        1 f28a4f1d
</pre>

<p>Because the index information must always match the actual file
contents, updating the index data after every revision / pack file
manipulation is mandatory in format 7. <tt>svnfsfs load-index</tt>
allows you to do that.  It consumes the same table format as produced
above, except that the checksum field is optional and will be ignored
if given.  See <a href="#svnfsfs-issues">the known issues list</a>

<p>In 1.9.0, the <tt>svnfsfs load-index</tt> does not work as described
in its documentation.  The following restrictions and workarounds apply:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The lines must be sorted by offset (first column).</li>
  <li>The item number (5th column) must be given as hexadecimal.  However,
      <tt>svnfsfs dump-index</tt> produces decimal numbers in that column.
  </li>
  <li>The first entry must refer to the first revision in the pack file.
      This is a non-issue for unpacked revisions. A simple solution is
      inserting a line for empty section of length 0: 
      <pre>
       Start       Length Type   Revision     Item 
           0            0 none       3000        0

<h4>Overview
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#fsx-overview"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h4>

<p>Since its inception 10 years ago, FSFS has been improved greatly and the
<a href="#fsfs-format7">improvements provided with format 7</a> are another
major step forward.  However, there are limits to what can be done in a
meaningful and backward compatible way.  FSX is being designed to overcome
these limitations.  Here some of the intended improvements:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>90% reduction in metadata overhead.</li>
  <li>Efficient handling of very large files.</li>
  <li>Higher overall compression rates, in particular for office-style
      documents.</li>
  <li>Information required for log and merge operations is more readily
      available.</li>
  <li>O(1) handling of large directories.</li>
  <li>Versioned revision properties.</li>
  <li>Partitionable storage.</li>
  <li>Arbitrary meta data storage and indexing facilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Development of FSX was started as a fork of FSFS to guarantee
functional completeness and testability.  The current code still contains
remnants of FSFS legacy code and not all of the above improvements have been
implemented yet.  Later releases will close the gap and remove transitional
code.

<h4>Usage scenarios

</h4>

<p>FSX is nowhere near as stable and reliable as FSFS.  Furthermore, there will
be no support for 1.9-style FSX repositories in 1.10
(see <a href="#fsx-incompatibility">Incompatibility</a>).  Think, therefore,
of all data in a FSX repository as being potentially corrupt.  Its improved
performance and storage characteristics, though, might make FSX a viable
option for the following use-cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Running analysis or reporting tools whose output does not need to be 100%
      reliable.  Use FSX as a high-speed data source in a read-only mirror.</li>
  <li>Investigate how FSX may fit into your future infrastructure.  How well
      does it perform with your data set concerning disk, I/O, RAM and CPU
      usage?</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<div class="notice">
  <p>If you experiment with FSX, please <a href="/mailing-lists">let

<h4>Incompatibility
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#fsx-incompatibility"

</h4>

<p>The FSX code and storage representation is in an intermediate state with
respect to the feature set that its developers have in mind.  For as long as
it keeps its experimental status, there will be neither forward nor backward
compatibility between FSX repositories of different Subversion feature releases.
Subversion 1.10 and later will recognize 1.9 FSX repositories and error out
on them.  You may use <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.reposadmin.maint.html#svn.reposadmin.maint.migrate.svnadmin">
dump and load</a> to upgrade an FSX repository from one release to another.</p>

<p>Dump and load is also the only upgrade path between FSFS and FSX.</p>

<p>Finally, there is no guarantee that FSX will eventually be released at all;
as an experimental backend, we make no promise that future releases will
support reading or writing FSX repositories.</p>

<p>Subversion 1.8 and earlier had two output modes: the default, human-oriented

<pre>
## Display the youngest revision of a repository:
% svn info --show-item=revision https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk
1693514

## Find the root directory of a working copy:
% svn info --show-item=wc-root
/home/jrandom/src/svn/trunk

<p>Incidentally, Subversion will also attempt to offer the correct selector name
if the argument was misspelled:</p>

<pre>
% svn info --show-item=wcroot
svn: E205000: Try 'svn help info' for more information
svn: E205000: 'wcroot' is not a valid value for --show-item; did you mean 'wc-root'?

<h4>Committing the result of large merges
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#fewer-ood-conditions"

</h4>

<p>Our best practices suggest that projects should branch and merge
at the project root level.  Each merge will then usually change the
<tt>svn:mergeinfo</tt> property at the project base folder.  To commit
that change, pre-1.9 servers require the client to have the latest
version of that base folder.  Whenever there is a commit in that tree,
its base folder will get a new revision as well, though.   Thus, in
large, busy projects, it is likely that by the time a large merge commit
would actually have reached its finalization phase, some other commit
got through and the merge commit is rejected for being out of date.  
</p>

<p>Subversion 1.9 now allows to modify directory properties based on
old revisions as long as the directory contents itself did no change.
Directory contents changes would either be property changes,  added or
removed entries.  Sub-tree or file contents changes no longer prevent
the property change from going through.  Of course, true file and tree
change conflicts will still result in out-of-date errors.
</p>

<p>This new behavior is not restricted to <tt>svn:mergeinfo</tt> changes
but applies to any directory properties.  Changes to <tt>svn:ignore</tt>
are another common scenario previously prone to update / commit /
out-of-date races.

In format 7 repositories, this will still perform a quick on-disk checksum
test of all data in rev / pack files but will only detect cases where
external forces (storage crash, rogue scripts etc.) modified committed data.
Also, the checksums are weaker (about a 1 in a billion chance that a random
change remains undetected) than the ones used to protect the user data.  If

you still need to run a full verification.</p>

<h3>Three-way conflict display, and <tt>diff3</tt> enhancements
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#three-way-conflict-markers"
     title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h3>
  
<p>When a text conflict occurs (and is not resolved by the interactive conflicts
resolver during <tt>svn update</tt>, <tt>svn switch</tt> or <tt>svn merge</tt>),
<em>conflicts markers</em> are written into the conflicted file.  Previous versions
of Subversion would render conflict markers as follows:</p>

<pre>
   Unconflicted lines
   &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; .mine
   Contents of the file in the working copy (including local modifications)
   =======
   Contents of the file in the revision being updated to
   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; .r2
   Unconflicted lines
</pre>

<p>As of Subversion 1.9, conflict markers would be rendered with information on
the base (called "older" in diff3 parlance):</p>

<pre>
   Unconflicted lines
   &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; .mine
   Contents of the file in the working copy (including local modifications)
   ||||||| .r1
   Contents of the file in the working copy's BASE revision
   =======
   Contents of the file in the revision being updated to
   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; .r2
   Unconflicted lines
</pre>

<p>Here, one resolves the conflict by manually applying to the
<tt>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</tt> hunk the same changes that would transform
the <tt>|||||||</tt> hunk into the <tt>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</tt> hunk.
For example, the following conflict:</p>

<pre>
   Unconflicted lines
   &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; .mine
   "Hello hello, world!"
   ||||||| .r1
   "Hello, world!"
   =======
   "Hello, ${name}!"
   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; .r2
   Unconflicted lines
</pre>

<p>should be resolved to:</p>

<pre>
   Unconflicted lines
   "Hello hello, ${name}!"
   Unconflicted lines
</pre>

<p>The three-way conflict display was already used by property conflicts and
by the interactive conflicts resolver in previous releases of Subversion.</p>

<p>The old, two-way conflict markers output can be obtained by setting
<tt>diff3-cmd</tt> in the <a
href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.advanced.confarea.html"
>Subversion runtime configuration</a> (or via the <tt>--config-option</tt>
or <tt>--diff3-cmd</tt> command-line options) to a <tt>diff3</tt>
command that generates two-way conflict markers.  Your system may already
include such a <tt>diff3</tt> program; one is also included with Subversion
and can be installed via <tt>make install-tools</tt> (Unix) or by building the
<tt>diff3</tt> or <tt>__MORE__</tt> targets (Windows).  On a typical Unix system,
simply setting <tt>diff3-cmd=diff3</tt> will restore two-way conflict markers.</p>

<p>Subversion 1.9 adds to the included <tt>diff3</tt> program
a <tt>--conflict-style</tt> marker that can be used to explicitly choose among
two-way conflict markers, three-way conflict markers, and a few other options.
That program can be used independently of Subversion anywhere a <tt>diff3</tt>
command is needed.</p>

<h3>Prospective blame

</h3>
  
<p>The <tt>blame</tt> command can now show not only when the <em>last</em>
change to each line of a given file was, but also when the <em>next</em> change
will be.</p>

<p>For example, to see for each line in revision&nbsp;3 of README.txt what the
next revision that changed (or removed) that line would be, run
<tt>svn blame -r HEAD:3 README.txt</tt>.  (You may need to pass a
<!-- TODO: link points to nightly (no 1.9 book branch yet) -->
<a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.advanced.pegrevs.html">peg
revision</a> if the file had been renamed since r3.)</p>

<p>In the <tt>blame</tt> command, the range <tt>-r&nbsp;M:N</tt> always means
"display information about the file at revision&nbsp;N".  If the range is
"forward" (M&lt;N) then the normal blame algorithm is used, displaying for each
line in the file when it was added or last changed; if the range is "reversed"
(M&gt;N) then the above-described sense is used, describing for each line in rN
when it was first changed (or deleted) after rN and before rM.</p>

<p>Here is an example, from Subversion's own repository.  The autoconf macro
<tt>SVN_CHECK_FOR_DUNDER_BUILTINS</tt> was
<a href="https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/subversion/trunk/build/ac-macros/svn-macros.m4?view=markup&amp;pathrev=1509167#l167"
>present in r1509167</a> but is not present in HEAD.  The <tt>blame</tt>
command can determine the revision in which the macro was removed:</p>

<pre>
% svn blame -r HEAD:1509167 svn-macros.m4
&vellip;
1509168   danielsh AC_DEFUN([SVN_CHECK_FOR_DUNDER_BUILTINS],
</pre>

<p>And indeed, <tt>svn diff -c r1509168</tt> shows that revision 
<a href="https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/subversion/trunk/build/ac-macros/svn-macros.m4?r1=1509168&amp;r2=1509167&amp;pathrev=1509168&amp;diff_format=h"
>deleting the definition of the macro</a>.</p>

<h3>Lock HTTP pipelining
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#lock-http-pipelining"
     title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h3>

<p>When locking, or unlocking, multiple files in a single operation
over HTTP the client will use HTTP pipelining for the individual
WebDAV LOCK and UNLOCK requests.  This makes the operation faster
particularly on connections with large network latency.  While HTTP
pipelining is new for LOCK and UNLOCK the client was already using it
for GET requests.</p>

<h3>Locking multiple files
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#locking-multiple-files"
     title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h3>

<p>Subversion locks, the locks that prevent commits from other working
copies, are stored in the repository. When adding or removing locks
the FSFS backend can now operate on several locks at once.  This
reduces the amount of disk IO when handling multiple locks and is
significant when the total number of locks in the repository is large,
100,000 say.</p>

<p>The default behaviour for commits is to automatically release locks
after a successful commit and this takes advantage of the more
efficient lock process.  In previous releases the disk IO involved in
releasing the locks would sometimes be greater than that involved in
creating the new revision.</p>

<p>Clients using the svn:// protocol will also benefit from the more
efficient lock handling when locking or unlocking multiple files in a
single operation.  Clients using HTTP will not get this benefit since
the client still sends multiple, pipelined, LOCK and UNLOCK requests,
one for each file.</p>

<p>The post-lock and post-unlock hooks receive multiple paths via
standard input.  In previous releases the repository backends always
operated on a single path at a time so only one path was ever passed
to the hook.  In 1.9 when multiple paths are locked or unlocked in a
single operation multiple paths will be passed to the hook.</p>

<p>The pre-lock and pre-unlock hooks continue to be passed a single
path as a parameter.</p>

<p>Subversion's Apache module, mod_dav_svn, can display statistics
that describe the status of the FSFS cache for the running Apache
instance.  To enable this define a Location block in the Apache
configuration file:</p>

<pre>
  &lt;Location /svn-status&gt;
    SetHandler svn-status
  &lt;/Location&gt;
</pre>

<p>Visiting the Location with a web browser will display statistics
about the FSFS cache for the running Apache instance.  If Apache is
configured to use multiple processes, most Unix deployments, the
statistics will only apply to the process that served the GET request
and repeating the request will cause different processes to be
queried.</p>

<p>There are some known issues in the Subversion 1.9 releases.  These
may be fixed in later 1.9.x releases.</p>

<div class="h3" id="no-op-changes">
<h3>No-op changes no longer dumped by '<tt>svnadmin dump</tt>'

<p>See <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SVN-4598">issue #4598 "No-op changes no longer dumped by 'svnadmin dump' in 1.9"</a>.
</p>

<p>It has always been possible, in atypical cases, for a commit to mark a
file as 'changed' without actually changing the file's text and/or
properties to a different value. Starting from 1.9.0, <tt>svnadmin dump</tt>
still outputs a record for such a file, including a header saying that the
action is 'change', but no longer appends a block describing the new text
for the file. (And similarly for properties, perhaps? TBD.) When
<tt>svnadmin load</tt> (1.8 or 1.9) reads this dumpfile, it does not record
any change in the repository for such a file.
</p>

<p>One user-visible effect is that, after dump and load, 'svn log -v' will
no longer list the path of such a file in its list of 'changed paths'.
</p>

<p>A fix for this problem has been included in the 1.9.3 release.

<p>If there are concurrent commits to the same repository, they may
randomly fail with an "out of date" error message without actually
being in conflict.  The problem presents itself to the user like any
legitimate out-of-date condition and retrying the commit as usual
will fix the problem.
</p>

<p>This problem is not new to Subversion 1.9 and limited to repositories
with high commit frequencies.  Triggering it requires either pre-1.7
clients, a pre-1.7 server or a server that has HTTPv2 explicitly disabled
via the <tt>SVNAdvertiseV2Protocol off</tt> option.  To avoid the problem,
consider upgrading clients and configuring the server to use the HTTPv2
protocol.

<p>svnserve and local repository access are not affected.

<p>Subversion 1.9 introduces new features and makes use of new techniques
which can trigger problems not encountered in previous versions. In contrast to
known issues, things listed here are not due to some bug or issue in Subversion
itself and therefore cannot be fixed with a new patch release.
This section lists all known problems and provides instructions to solve them,
if they occur.</p>

<h3>Lock/Unlock errors related to HTTP pipelining
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#http-pipelining-issue"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h3>

<p>Subversion 1.9.0 introduces the use of HTTP pipelining for locking/unlocking
multiple files. While SVN detects whether HTTP pipelining is supported (and
falls back to non HTTP pipelining mode, if it isn't), issues can arrise, if
there are flaws or bugs with any of the protocols/applications involved in
processing pipelined HTTP requests.</p>

<p>Especially, if there are older proxies present in the network topology, it's
possible that you run into issues, since being a technology which was
introduced in HTTP/1.1 (and the full performance benefit is not expected unless
you are using HTTP/2), this feature might have not been extensively tested by
your proxy vendor.</p>

<p>To troubleshoot whether the proxy is causing an issue, try to lock/unlock
multiple files bypassing the proxy. If that works, please get in touch with
the proxy vendor to notify him about the problem and ask for support.</p>

<p>It's also appreciated, if you would let the SVN developers know about the
effected proxy via the users mailing list so this troubleshooting section can
be updated.</p>

<p>At the moment there is one potentially known proprietary proxy running into
this issue: Java-SSL-tunnel. See
<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tortoisesvn/h72AhfjwcbQ/RfTVgbXqCwAJ"
